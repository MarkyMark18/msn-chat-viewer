A simple Qt/C++ application to parse and view chat logs from old MSN Messenger XML history files.

## About The Project

I started this project as a C++ learning exercise after I found some old MSN Messenger log files on a backup drive. Historically, you could open these files in IE and it would format them using the styling from the original messages, however on modern browsers (Including Edge's IE mode) one of three things happens:
- The messages display on a single line, with no formatting
- The entire file (including XML tags) displays on a single line
- A blank page!

Rather than using an inbuilt XML library, I built a manual file parser as practice. The application successfully reads the log files generated by MSN Messenger, extracts the messages and displays them in a readable format, including message headers and the styling used on the original messages.

## Features

- **Open and Parse XML:** Load `.xml` chat history files generated by MSN Messenger
- **Display Original Formatting:** Renders the original formatting (font, colour) used on the orignal message

## Build and Run
Build using the Qt6 framework and CMake

1. **Prerequisites:** Use Qt6 (with [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools)) and a C++ compiler (I used MVSC on Windows, installed through [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project in Qt Creator by opening the `CMakeLists.txt` file
4. Qt Creator should automatically configure the project.
5. Build the project by either clicking the 'Build' button (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2625d171-ff9c-46df-af98-b18848055856)) or pressing `Ctrl+B`
6. Run the project by either clicking the 'Run' button (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1016fe8c-f5c4-43fb-96d7-9183c37824fb))  or pressing `Ctrl+R`

## Future Plans

This is a work-in-progress learning project. Some of the features and improvements planned for the future are:
- **Improve UI Styling:** Move away from the default OS window style to something resembling the original MSN Messenger theme.
- **Enhanced Formatting:** Add support for more of MSN Messenger's features, such as bold, italics and emoticons.
- **Preferences:** Add a preferences window where users can change settings such as display options, themes and fonts.
- **Improved Error Handling:** Add ability for the parser to handle corrupted files gracefully.
- **Chat History Database:** Allow importing multiple chat history files and saving these within the application, rather than loading single files.
